🌱 Mind Care – Mental Wellness Dashboard

This is a web app I built using React that focuses on mental wellness.
The idea is to give users a calm space where they can track their moods, write daily reflections, try mindfulness exercises, and get small insights or motivational tips.

✨ What’s Inside

📊 Mood Tracking – record how you feel each day and spot patterns

📖 Daily Reflections / Journals – write down your thoughts in a private space

📚 Lessons & Guides – short guides about stress, mindfulness, resilience

🌟 Stories & Experiences – inspiring stories for motivation

🧘 Mindfulness Tasks – simple exercises like breathing or gratitude notes

💡 Personalized Tips – small reminders or advice based on activity

🎨 Cartoon Avatars – neutral fun avatars (so everyone gets a friendly face)

🛠️ Tech Used

React.js for the frontend

CSS for styling (gradients, cards, animations)

LocalStorage to save reflections and progress

React Router for navigation

DiceBear Avatars for the profile pictures

🚀 How to Run It

Clone the repo and go into the folder:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/FEDF_FINAL.git
cd mindful-moments


Install everything:

npm install


Start the app:

🌟 Why I Made This

I wanted to create something small but meaningful for mental health.
It combines ideas like journaling, mindfulness, and motivational content into one dashboard. The design is simple but friendly, and I tried to keep it easy to use.
